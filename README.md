# Smart Garden

### Description:
This project is a web-based platform about plants and their cultivation. It should provide a range of services like a blog, a chat, a gallery and others. But the main goal is an application to control the breeding of plants. Therefore devices are needed, which are sold in the shop. After creating an account the user register a main device to get access to its dashboard through internet. When the serialnumber is correct, he can add modules like sensor for soil moisture to it, which are connected to the hub by RF. The actual measured value and bevor that in a period of 30 minutes will be shown on the display. The data of the devices get stored in the cloud. Now the user is able to observe or control the grow of his plants by using lights, waterpumps, heatings, etc. The collected data of the users can be used to determine an optimized template of each kind of plant as an offer for an automized planting.
